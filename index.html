            <h2 id="hello">My name is Mathew Murray,</h2>
            <p>I'm a student at Thinkful, studying software engineering. I'm a Pennsylvania native currently living in Florida.
              My experience ranges from Customer Service at a small town restaurant, to manufacturing Harley's and circuit boards for
              Collins aerospace and SMTC in Melbourne, FL.
            </p>
            <p> As a nerd, my whole life I've sought to take science fiction to reality.</p>
            <p>Have a look around and feel free to <a href=#contact>contact me!</a></p>

              <div class="item item-double">
                <p>Growing up, people always told me "you're different". And they are right. I was diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome when
                  I was 12. This is a form of higher function autism. This means I become super focused on projects and activities I enjoy. 
                  It was a few years later that I was introduced to website design and coding. I knew then, That was my future.
                  I'm enrolled in <a href= "http://thinkful.com">Thinkful.com's</a> engineering immersion program to apply that hyper focus
                  and personal drive into something I can be proud of. </p>
            <p>If you're looking for a fresh set of eyes or even a team member to collaborate with, please contact me. I'm always up for a game of Magic as well!</p>
